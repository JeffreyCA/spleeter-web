Spleeter Web is a web application for isolating or removing the vocal, accompaniment, bass, and/or drum components of any song. For example, you can use it to isolate the vocals of a track, or you can use it remove the vocals to get an instrumental version of a song.

It is powered by [Spleeter](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter), an awesome source separation library from Deezer that uses deep learning to separate the various components of a song. Spleeter Web uses the pretrained model [`4stems-model`](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/3.-Models#pretrained-model), which performs very well on the [*MusDB*](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html) benchmark.

The app uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for the backend API and [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend. [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html) is used for the task queue.

## Getting started with Docker
### Requirements
* 4 GB+ of memory (source separation is memory-intensive)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Instructions
0. (Optional) Set the YouTube Data API key (for YouTube search functionality):

    You can skip this step, but you would not be able to import songs by searching with a query. You would still be able to import songs via YouTube links though.

    Create an `.env` file at the project root with the following contents:
    ```
    YOUTUBE_API_KEY=<YouTube Data API key>
    ```

1. Build and start containers using the development Docker config:

    ```sh
    spleeter-web$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
    ```

2. Launch **Spleeter Web**

    Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser. Uploaded tracks and generated mixes will appear in `media/uploads` and `media/separate` respectively on your host machine.

## Getting started without Docker
### Requirements
* 4 GB+ of memory (source separation is memory-intensive)
* Python 3.6+ ([link](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Node.js 12+ ([link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
* Redis ([link](https://redis.io/))
* ffmpeg and ffprobe ([link](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html))
    * On macOS, you can install using Homebrew or MacPorts
    * On Windows, you can follow [this guide](http://blog.gregzaal.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows/)

### Instructions
1. Set environment variables

    **Make sure these variables are set when running all subsequent commands.**

    ```sh
    # Unix/macOS:
    (env) spleeter-web$ export DJANGO_DEVELOPMENT=true
    (env) spleeter-web$ export YOUTUBE_API_KEY=<api key>
    # Windows:
    (env) spleeter-web$ set DJANGO_DEVELOPMENT=true
    (env) spleeter-web$ set YOUTUBE_API_KEY=<api key>
    ```
2. Create Python virtual environment
    ```sh
    spleeter-web$ python -m venv env
    # Unix/macOS:
    spleeter-web$ source env/bin/activate
    # Windows:
    spleeter-web$ .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```
3. Install Python dependencies
    ```sh
    (env) spleeter-web$ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Install Node dependencies
    ```sh
    spleeter-web$ cd frontend
    spleeter-web/frontend$ npm install
    ```
5. Ensure Redis server is running on `localhost:6379` (needed for Celery)

    You can run it on a different host or port, but make sure to update `CELERY_BROKER_URL` and `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` in `settings.py`. It must be follow the format: `redis://host:port/db`.

6. Apply migrations
    ```sh
    (env) spleeter-web$ python manage.py migrate
    ````
7. Start frontend
    ```sh
    spleeter-web$ npm run dev --prefix frontend
    ```
8. Start backend in separate terminal
    ```sh
    (env) spleeter-web$ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
    ````

9. Start Celery workers in separate terminal
    ```sh
    (env) spleeter-web$ celery multi start fast slow -l INFO -Q:fast fast_queue -Q:slow slow_queue,fast_queue -c:fast 3 -c:slow 1 -A api --pidfile=./celery_%n.pid --logfile=./celery_%n%I.log --statedb=celery.state
    ```
    The above command launches two Celery workers: **fast** and **slow**. **fast** processes YouTube imports and **slow** processes source separation. **fast** can work on 3 tasks concurrently, while **slow** can only work on 1 task concurrently. Feel free to adjust these values to your fitting.

    To stop the workers, run:
    ``sh
    (env) spleeter-web$ celery multi stop fast slow --pidfile=./celery_%n.pid --logfile=./celery_%n%I.log
    ```

10. Launch **Spleeter Web**
    Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser. Uploaded and mixed tracks will appear in `media/uploads` and `media/separate` respectively.

## Configuration

### Django settings

| Settings file | Description |
|---|---|
| `django_react/settings.py` | The base Django settings used when launched in non-Docker context. |
| `django_react/settings_dev.py` | Contains the **override** settings used when run in development mode (i.e. `DJANGO_DEVELOPMENT` is set). |

| `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` | YouTube Data API key. |

## Using cloud storage (Azure Storage, AWS S3, etc.)

By default, **Spleeter Web** uses the local filesystem to store uploaded files and mixes. It supports many other storage backends like Azure Storage or S3 using [django-storages](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

You can edit `django_react/settings_docker.py` (if using Docker) or `django_react/settings_dev.py` and set `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` to another backend like `'storages.backends.azure_storage.AzureStorage'`.

In the same file, set the storage backend configuration values (`AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY` and `AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME` if using Azure).

**CORS**

To play back a dynamic mix, you may need to configure your storage service's CORS settings to allow the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.

## Deployment
**Spleeter Web** can be deployed on a VPS or a cloud server such as Azure VMs, AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, etc. Deploying to cloud container services like ECS is not yet supported out of the box.

1. Clone this git repo
    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/JeffreyCA/spleeter-web.git
    $ cd spleeter-web
    ```

2. If you want your server to self-host the media files instead of using a cloud storage provider, then first edit `django_react/settings_docker.py` and uncomment this line:
    ```
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage'
    ```
    Next, update `docker-compose.prod.selfhost.yml` and replace `/path/to/media` with the path where media files should be stored on the server.

3. In `spleeter-web`, create an `.env` file with the production environment variables

    `.env` file:
    ```
    APP_HOST=<domain name or public IP of server>
    AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY=<account key>                   # Optional
    AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME=<account name>                 # Optional
    AZURE_CONTAINER=<container name>                  # Optional
    CELERY_FAST_QUEUE_CONCURRENCY=<concurrency count> # Optional (default = 3)
    CELERY_SLOW_QUEUE_CONCURRENCY=<concurrency count> # Optional (default = 1)
    YOUTUBE_API_KEY=<youtube api key>                 # Optional
    ```

    These values are referenced in `django_react/settings_docker.py` and `docker-compose.yml`, so you can also edit those files directly to set your production settings.

4. Build and start production containers

    If you are self-hosting media files:
    ```sh
    spleeter-web$ sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.prod.selfhost.yml up --build -d
    ```

    Otherwise if using a storage provider:
    ```sh
    spleeter-web$ sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d
    ```

4. Access **Spleeter Web** at whatever you set `APP_HOST` to. Note that it will be running on port 80, not 8000.

## Common issues & FAQs

### How do I update Spleeter Web?
**If you are updating to v1.1.0 or later and you use Docker to run Spleeter Web, please note that the database backend has changed from PostgreSQL to SQLite. Please backup your track list as the data in the DB will not carry over when updating. Your media files will not be impacted.**

First, do a `git pull` to fetch the latest changes. Then, if you are using Docker, just re-run `docker-compose` with the `--build` flag to re-build the containers. If you are not using Docker, you will need to re-run `pip install -r requirements` and `python manage.py migrate` and `npm install` (in the `frontend` directory).

### I get a CORS error when trying to play a dynamic mix.

To play a dynamic mix, you will need to configure your storage service's CORS settings to allow the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.

For more information on how to do this on Azure, see [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/cross-origin-resource-sharing--cors--support-for-the-azure-storage-services).

### When playing a track I cannot perform seeks.
The server that is hosting your media files has to support [**byte-range requests**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests) in order for you to be able to perform seeks.

If you are running Spleeter Web locally and storing your media files locally as well, this is expected behaviour as the development Django webserver does not support byte-range requests. You can try to configure it to use nginx + gunicorn instead.

If you are using Azure Blob storage, you need to increase the API version to `2011-01-18` or newer, as the default API version does not support it. See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17408927/do-http-range-headers-work-with-azure-blob-storage-shared-access-signatures)  StackOverflow post for more details. Or just run [this](https://gist.github.com/JeffreyCA/d5c544df36a0f61737f8a435f897de5e) simple C# program.

### Why is Redis needed?
The main advantage of using Redis with Celery is so that the user can revoke/terminate in-progress tasks. This is only possible with Redis or amqp brokers.
